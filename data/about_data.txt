Dataset: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

Description:
This dataset consists of grayscale MRI images of human brains categorized into four classes:
1. glioma        - 300 images
2. meningioma    - 306 images
3. notumor       - 405 images
4. pituitary     - 300 images

Image Format: JPG
Color Format: Grayscale
Typical Image Size: Varies (standardized to 150x150 during preprocessing)

Folder Structure:
- Each class is stored in its own subfolder under both `Training` and `Testing` directories.
- Example path: `Training/glioma/xxx.jpg`

Notes:
- The "notumor" class includes healthy brain images.
- The dataset combines images from Figshare, SARTAJ, and Br35H sources.
- Glioma images from SARTAJ were removed due to mislabeling concerns and replaced with Figshare images.

Use:
Designed for deep learning tasks such as image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify brain tumors.
